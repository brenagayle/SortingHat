Welcome to the code for a Harry Potter Sorting Hat game! When you find yourself on the landing page you have the option to click the Sorting Hat and be sorted into your very own Hogwarts House! Should you find yourself in House Slytherin, not only will you be told your housemates but also find out who among you is a muggle. 

This project was created with a goal to find an api and use it to call information.

*This is a project I would like to expand upon and turn into a full fledged fan sight.
